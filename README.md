# Project SANE

Deployed app: https://desolate-fjord-57134.herokuapp.com/

## About This Application

Project S.A.N.E. is a tool designed for locating sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) throughout the Rocky Mountain Region. It integrates the ability to search for by city, county and facility and returns information based on what is passed through. On searching for each of those, the map will re-render to focus on the locations based on the search results. 

We also included a place where people can share their stories with other users to build a sense of community around shared experiences. 

This project was developed as a part of the University of Denver's first all women's full stack web development cohort.
